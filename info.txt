=========================================================
Short description

Technology stack:
Front-End - React, Bootstrap
Back-End - NodeJS, Express.js, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, nanoid

Successefully managed:

Created Back End side using Node.js + MongoDB.
It was possible to reduce long URLS to short ones and store the data in the database.
I used an additional package (nanoid) to shorten the URLS. 
CRUD operations Successefully work.
Created a table to draw all items from the database.

Such problems during work:

First experience with back-end and MongoDB. Difficulties with client & server side synchronization
!!! IMPORTANT: Used my personal credentials to work with MongoDB. It would be better to replace them with others (company, client)
Due to lack of time, it was not possible to add the following: on UI element removal, loader, code refactoring, responsive
